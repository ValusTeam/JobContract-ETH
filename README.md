# JobContract
An Ethereum smart contract for applying and paying for services using Ether without the need of two parties to trust a third party that would hold the funds in the time of execution. Thus two parties can exchange services with as trustless as possible.

## How it works?
- This projects contains a JobContract that represents an Ethereum smart contract. This contract is created by the second contract in this project named JobContractParent which calls a constructor to create a new JobContract without needing to compile it separately. 
- Truffle testing framework is used to present the contracts and their functionalities and needs to be installed if needed.

## Installation
First install Truffle:

```shell
npm install -g truffle
```
